# C6

This is where the C6 Collective app will live. For now, it's a simple version
of the Provider Portal that just fetches provider data from the NPI Registry
API.

## Setup
1 - Clone this repo with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkprow/c6
```

2 - Install the Node project's dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

3 - Start the server with:
```
npm start
```

At this point, you should be looking at the app in a browser window.
